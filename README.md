# Starlight
This is the source code for Starlight, a stary themed puzzle game.

Since there is no .exe file to run the game, you will need to download the GODOT engine in order to run this project. When this game is finished, a .exe will be included for you to download, but it will be in a separate folder marked as such. Untill then, no such .exe will exist.
